# RoboMaster UI Designer

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

The first ever of its kind, 
WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) custom UI designing tool for RoboMaster.

## Building

This is tested to work with Qt 5.15.2.

You must open `i18n/RoboMasterUIDesigner_zh_CN.ts` with Qt Linguist manually,
publish the translation as QM file under the same directory first.
I plan to solve this problem but it doesn't seem very easy to do
